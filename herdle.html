         <h2> Overview </h2>
         <p>Herdle is a native mobile application designed to help users split bills between groups. It's primarily centred around sending payments and receiving notifications to keep track of their expenditure.</P>
<h2> Statistics </h2>

<h2> Problems </h2>
<p>There are a large number of applications on the market that allow users to split bills with others. However, most of these apps require subscriptions or premium upgrades to access all the features they have to offer.  Most are unhelpful regarding navigation and overall use; it's inconvenient and an annoyance to the user. </p>
<h2> Solutions </h2>
<p> Herdle was designed to fix these issues. It offers a more personalised experience for the user. It allows them to add friends and create groups based on who the cost will be split between. Users can add multiple payment accounts and activate notifications that keep them up to date. </p>

       <li>
         "I want to be able to create groups so me and my friends can access the
same expenses"
       </li>
       <li>
         "I want to be able to protect my account and personal information"
       </li>
       <li>
         "As a user, I want to add multiple payment options to make things easier"
